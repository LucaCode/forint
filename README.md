## What is Forint

***Forint*** is a high-performance MongoDB inspired TypeScript query library.
You can use it to check if a value matches with a given query or to filter an array.
Forint prepares queries to get high-performance when executing a query multiple times. 

## How to use Forint

### Basic usage

```typescript
import forint from "forint";

interface Person {
    name: string
    age: number
    hobbies: string[]
}

//Some random persons
const persons: Person[] = [...];

//Build a query typesafe
const adultQuery = forint<Person>({
    age: {$gte: 18}
});

//Use it to check if a value matches
const matches = adultQuery(persons[0]);

//Or to filter an array
const adults = persons.filter(adultQuery);
```

### Queries

Forint queries are nested objects with filters. 
A filter is a simple object property starting with a dollar symbol. 
These filter objects can be assigned to a query property.
When you assign a non-object type value to a query property or use it 
as a query, the $eq filter is automatically used. 

```typescript
import forint from "forint";

forint({
    age: {
        //Filter object
        $gte: 18,
        $lte: 30,
    },
    car: {
        color: {
            //Filter object
            $in: ["black","white"]
        },
        //Will automatically converted to {$eq: 50000}
        price: 50000
    }
})
```

### Supported filters

***$eq: any***  
Checks if the value is deep equal.

***$ne: any***  
Checks if the value is not deep equal.

***$ceq: any***  
Checks if the value is content deep equal (== instead of ===).

***$nce: any***  
Checks if the value is not content deep equal. (!= instead of !==).

***$or: ForintQuery[]***  
Checks if one of the queries is matching.

***$gt: number***  
Checks if the value is greater.

***$gte: number***  
Checks if the value is greater or equals.

***$lt: number***  
Checks if the value is lesser.

***$lte: number***  
Checks if the value is lesser or equals.

***$in: ForintQuery[]***  
Checks if the value is matching with one of these queries.

***$nin: ForintQuery[]***  
Checks if the value is not matching with one of these queries.

***$type: 'string' | 'number' | 'object' | 'array' | 'boolean' | 'null'***  
Checks the data type of the value.

***$all: ForintQuery[]***  
Checks if any elements in the array match all given queries 
without regard to order or other elements in the array.

***$elemMatch: ForintQuery***  
Checks if at least one array element matches the query.

***$len: number***  
Checks the length of an array.

***$not: ForintQuery | ForintQuery[]***  
Checks if all specified queries are not matching.

***$and: ForintQuery[]***  
Checks if all queries are matching with the value.

***$regex: string***  
Checks that the value matches with the regex.

***$exists: boolean***
