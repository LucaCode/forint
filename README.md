## What is Queric

***Queric*** is a high-performance MongoDB inspired TypeScript query library.
You can use it to check if a value matches with a given query or to filter an array.
Queric prepares queries to get high-performance when executing a query multiple times. 

## How to use Queric

### Basic usage

```typescript
import queric from "queric";

interface Person {
    name: string
    age: number
    hobbies: string[]
}

//Some random persons
const persons: Person[] = [...];

//Build a query typesafe
const adultQuery = queric<Person>({
    age: {$gte: 18}
});

//Use it to check if a value matches
const matches = adultQuery(persons[0]);

//Or to filter an array
const adults = persons.filter(adultQuery);
```

### Queries

Queric queries are nested objects with filters. 
A filter is a simple object property starting with a dollar symbol. 
These filter objects can be assigned to a query property.
When you assign a non-object type value to a query property or use it 
as a query, the $eq filter is automatically used. 

```typescript
import queric from "queric";

queric({
    age: {
        //Filter object
        $gte: 18,
        $lte: 30,
    },
    car: {
        color: {
            //Filter object
            $in: ["black","white"]
        },
        //Will automatically converted to {$eq: 50000}
        price: 50000
    }
})
```
